# Google-Sign-in-Demo

A demo app that demonstrates the use of the Google Sign-In API. On sign-in user profile information will be extracted from the google account and displayed in a profile page. The user is then free to sign out from their google account taking them back to the sign-in page.

A Google API Console Project must be configured for your app. This involves configuring an OAuth 2.0 Client which will require the SHA-1 signing certificate of your app. The Credentials .json file can then be downloaded and moved to the 'app' folder of your app.
